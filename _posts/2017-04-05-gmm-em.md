A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that assumes all the
data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of
Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of
mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate
information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the
centers of the latent Gaussians.

A GMM is
useful for modeling data that comes from one of several groups: the
groups might be different from each other, but data points within the same group can be well-modeled by a
Gaussian distribution.

I found this [note](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/content/gmm-em.pdf) is very useful to understand the underlying theory.

Scikit-learn implements different classes to estimate Gaussian mixture
models, that correspond to different estimation strategies, detailed
below.

# Scikit Installation
For Linux and MacOS, If you already have a working installation of
numpy and scipy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip
```{bash}
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
or conda:

```{bash}
conda install scikit-learn
```
*Note: Please be consistent when using pip or conda, e.g. to upgrade
or uninstall scikit-learn installed with Anaconda or conda you should
not use the pip command.*
