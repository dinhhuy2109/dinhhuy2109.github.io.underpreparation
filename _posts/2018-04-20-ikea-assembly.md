As an ordinary day, I opened the news app on my phone, went to the robotics news tab, and ... this news is everywhere. The autonomous assembly of an IKEA chair was featured on many major international news pages, including [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/18/defeated-by-ikeas-flatpack-call-in-the-robots), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/science/robots-ikea-furniture.html), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21740733-cower-your-silicon-overlords-puny-humans-robots-can-assemble-ikea), [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-04-19/semi-autonomous-robot-assembles-ikea-chair-frame-artificial/9670464), [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/can-robot-build-ikea-chair-faster-you), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04779-w), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/a-robot-does-the-impossible-assembling-an-ikea-chair-without-having-a-meltdown/), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/610929/robots-are-about-as-good-as-you-at-assembling-ikea-furniture/), [CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq2nWNZEjj8), [Reuters](https://reuters.com/video/2018/04/19/flatpack-fear-no-more-robot-assembles-ik?videoId=419292893&videoChannel=1), etc.

It is an honor to be a part of this group. Happy that I did help in doing the calibrations and 3D perceptions for the project.
