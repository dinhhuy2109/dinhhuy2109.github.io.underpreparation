This a project developed during a course about software engineering. The main goal was to design and implement an application to simulate algorithms on Kephera III robots in order to study their behavior in different mazes. 


The ultimate goal of providing the client application as a tool that allows him/her to test the code without having to use any setup neither the real robot. The simulator only covers those aspects of the robot, the maze and the user interface.
