We introduce a self-learning robotics course online at
**[http://osrobotics.org/pages/introduction_osr.html](http://osrobotics.org/pages/introduction_osr.html)**. The
course is aimed at anyone who has a general interest in robots and now
wishes to learn more about robotics. We hope you'll find the course
entertaining, informative and worthwhile!

The topics range from *Manipulator kinematics, Motion planning, Robot
vision, System integration, Force control, etc.*

You may also find
installation and start-up guides for some useful softwares *(e.g. Ubuntu,
Python, Git, OpenRave, OpenCV, PCL, ROS, Gazebo)*.

Cheers,
