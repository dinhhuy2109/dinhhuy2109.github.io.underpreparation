The project is inspired by [petros vrellis](http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/knit.html)'s work.

Long time ago I saw a video of this guy making stunning knitted portrait with a single thread. I think.. this definitely is another perfect blend of art and sciene (just like what we did with the [light drawing project](https://dinhhuy2109.github.io/projects/light-drawing/)). Therefore I decided to build the algorithm doing the same thing.

Note that to make these portraits, all you need is **a long single thread, and a circle frame**.

And belows are the results. Can you recognize them?

{:refdef: style="text-align: center; width: 250px;"}

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/celeb1.png">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/celeb2.png">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/celeb3.png">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/myta.png ">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
{: refdef}

These are just some rendered images of the final product. I will try to make a real one soon :)
