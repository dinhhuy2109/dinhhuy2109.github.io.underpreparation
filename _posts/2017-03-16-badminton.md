The badminton racket is the most important equipment. Before you
choose your own badminton racket, ask yourself whether you want to
play a game of *POWER* or *CONTROL*.

*POWER* means that you want to deliver *lethal* smashes to win your
 oponent, and *CONTROL* means being able to drive the shuttlecock with
 high precision. Remember that you can not have both power and control
 in one racket. However, you can choose to have a balance of both.

To choose a good badminton racket that suits you, serval things to
consider:

# Stiffness/Flexibility of the Shaft:
A flexible shaft can bend easily, whereas a stiff shaft can hardly
bend.

**A flexible shaft** offers good repulsion of the shuttlecock in a
badminton swing. This is because a flexible shaft bends slightly
towards the back and stores energy during your swing motion. As the
shuttle comes into contact with the string bed of the racket, the
stored energy will be released and then transferred to the
shuttlecock. Therefore the holder of the racket does not have to exert
too much strength for badminton shots such as badminton clears from
baseline to baseline.

However, you will have to sacrifies shot placement accuracy. Since the
shuttle lands on the string bed of the racket, repulsion will cause
the head of the racket to vibrate, leading to uncertainty in the
flight direction of the shuttlecock.

Therefore, this type of rackets is _most suitable for beginner or
defensive players_. Also racket with flexible shaft help you to _defend
smashes easier_.

**A Stiff Shaft** offers little or no repulsion.  The shuttle will
  bounce off immediately after it comes into contact with the string
  bed of the racket. With less repulsion, shots are less powerful. This
  means that the holder of the badminton racket will have to swing
  harder in order to generate more power.

However, this type of shaft is perfect for accurate shuttlecock
placement and suitable for _Fast Attacks, Deceptions, Net kill_.

If you’re a beginner using a stiff badminton racket, you’ll find
yourself concentrating on exerting sufficient strength into your
swing, rather than concentrating on correct techniques. _Intermediate or advanced players_ who are very familiar with correct badminton techniques can consider switching to a stiff racket to try out more advanced skills.

# Balance Point & Weight

**Balance point** is the point on the badminton shaft that indicates the CENTER of
MASS of the badminton racket.

**Weight** of the racket ussually is classified into a few categories,
namely:

*-2U*: 90-94g

*-3U*: 85-89g

*-4U*: 80-84g

*-5U*: 75-79g

These infomations are often indicated on the shaft of the racket (near
 where you hold the racket). 

*Head-heavy rackets*  and *heavy rackets* will allow you to channel
more power into your smashes. However, they are not as easy to control
due to the extra weight.

*Head-light rackets* and *lighweight rackets* on the oposite will
allow for quick stroking speeds and recovery. You will be able to
deliver quick serves and switch to different strokes
easily. Lightweight rackets also are easier on the wrist and
shoulders, reducing the chances of injuries.

# And more
This is not all! You still need to choose suitable **type of string**,
**string tension** and **hand grip**, but above are some of the most
important things that I usually consider before buying a new
racket. And of course, the racket need to fit your budget. :)
